        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oven to 190C / 170 fan / gas 5. Butter the base and sides of two 20cm round sandwich tins and line the bases with baking parchment.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, beat together the sugar, butter, eggs, flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, vanilla extract, milk and a pinch of salt until pale.</li>
            <li>Divide the mixtures between the prepared tins. Bake for 20 mins or until a skewer inserted into the center of cake comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Leave to cool in the thin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>For the buttercream, put chopped milk chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt in the microwave, stirring every 30 secs. Leave the melted chocolate to cool for 5 mins.</li>
            <li>Mash softened butter and icing sugar together with a fork, then switch to a wooden spoon or electric beaters, if you have them.</li>
            <li>Sift in cocoa powder with a pinch of salt and pour the melted chocolate and milk. Mix again until smooth.</li>
            <li>On a cake stand or large plate, sandwich the cakes together with half of the buttercream, then spread the rest on top. Decorate with chocolate shards, if you like.</li>
            <li>To make chocolate shards: melt dark chocolate and pour it onto a tray lined with baking parchment or foil.</li>
            <li>Now melt milk chocolate and white chocolate and drizzle them over the dark chocolate before it sets.</li>
            <li>Shake the tray gently to level the mixture then leave to set somewhere cool. Chop into shards.</li>
        </ol>
